          what is going on guys today we are back with another one of those competitive analysis videos it's actually been a while since I've done one of these I mean I guess if you disclude the team showcase when I did and actually I don't even know if that bit is going to be up by the time this one's up but if it's not at least you know what's to come so anyway yep we have another competitive analysis video this is going to be different than the usual ones I do where it's like the poll Pokemon lish then we
          
          talk about the pokemons purpose in the or sou met a game and that sort of thing this is definitely going to be a little bit more similar to the video titled how to deal with stall in the or sou met a game so this is basically I don't know what I'm going to actually title this but let's just for now call it the most important things to keep in mind in a Pokemon battle that's basically what if this is this videos going to be about now this can mean a tournament battle a basic ladder battle oh it doesn't really
          
          mean it really doesn't matter it's basically just the things you need to know when you're going into your battle now this isn't like a tournament thing where you have to like I'm not going to be talking about like you need to scout your opponent know exactly what kind of Pokemon they're going to bring note that down counter team but it's not it's none of that it's not preparing for a battle it's when you send out your first pokémon into the 6v6 level playing field what you can do in that battle to up
          
          your chances of winning and basically win the battle so let's you know let's just hop right into it so one of the first things I want to talk about and one of the I guess one of the big mistakes that a lot of people make is they just don't think about lead matchup now it's easy to kind of ignore that because you're just thinking okay I just send out whatever pokemon I want it's 6v6 at level I can always you know outplay if it's bad but look it's it's all that but the thing is lead matchup is a very very important part of the
          
          game and it's especially important when you have a certain matchup like offense versus offense obviously if it's something like stall bursts all it really doesn't matter because you're just gonna switching your chance or your say but anyway like it's it's whatever but in a thing like offense first offense or even like a bulkier team there's another bulkier team it's going to be like important to know what to lead off with what's going to give me the biggest advantage and that sort of things so let's break down this battle
          
          right here this is between ray ku and on Google for SPO this was actually week nine so they're both in or SL you let's take a quick look at their teams so as you can see here on focus team is basically a pretty offensive build but it's like more of a bulky ish offense you see he has some pivots in the form of heat Randers and even though his latias is life form it's still gonna be able to sponge a lot of hits and it's a really good water resist so you know his team is offense but it's bulkier because he has the pivots records riku's
          
          team on the other hand is again offensive but it's much much frailer and it's just it's way more geared toward hyper offense if anything as you can see he's like he's very very weak to scarf Keldeo if his Latios dies and that kind of thing he doesn't exactly have the same exact pivots that i'm fuga has the only real pivot raikou has on here is like the Landorus and I guess AV bisharp but so basically as you can see from their teams they're still both two very offensive teams on focus is just a little bit bulkier and that kind of
          
          thing but let's talk about lead matchup because that's what the focus is right now if you can look at Rick who's team Rick who actually does not have a very resist now this could have been kind of a mess up in his own team building but let's just you can see that he has no solid favorites maybe his mentality with this team is he can overpower the popular fairies like left guard and okay that's probably his mentality is so it's fine let's just break it down so I'm forget to see that as well so he's thinking hmm
          
          maybe I can lead off with my Gardevoir and just net a free kill but if Rick were to lead off with something like lopunny the garden bar would get easily just killed by the combination effect out in return the thing is from fuga is he can still lead off with his Gardevoir and if raikou does decide to lead off with a slow pony on foga instantly forces the 50-50 if i'm focal goes into his Lander stay on the fake-out he only takes like 10% Riku takes these 17% from helmet and then a freakin wants the ice punch to do
          
          a little bit more damage on focus going to end up he could um pouco could end up earth-quaking pretty much just killed opening immediately which is bad because then Rick who loses his main form of speed and his main thing to outspeed weavile or if he wants to switch out I'm pulling might be able to even get up rocks and that would break you automatically in a disadvantageous position because one his loping he took damage and two rocks are already up and i'm puga is just you know heavily like he's just as a heavy advantage so
          
          basically what goes on between these two is unfocused sides okay I can lead off with the Gardevoir and again even if he leads off with this lopunny it's fine unfocus also meant also his mentality could have been that Rick who might want to even lead off with this keldeo now the reason I could have let off of this Cal deal is it beats the lead of Landers T say I'm for going wanted to get up rocks ASA keldeo specs Cal they'll kind of just put that at bay on top of that I'm a kiss guard a possible Weavile lead or
          
          heat rent and that kind of thing and if I'm gonna want to lead off with latias for some reason Rick who knows it's not a big deal because you can always go into his AV bisharp and you know just pursue trap that thing and that kind of thing so that's both of their mentalities so um Rick who's actually gonna end up trying to predict dump with a leadoff at Landers T as a focus gonna lead off a Gardevoir cuz again I'm Poconos it's fine if he leads off with a low penny yes I'm gonna have to switch but I'm
          
          going to be doing damage to him I'm gonna get the rocks up I'm gonna have an advantage and I'm actually ends up getting that right because Rick who isn't going to lead off with low penny he's actually going to lead off with Kelly oh trying to get his own lead initiative match up the no it's not leading nation is the lead match up initiative so I'm food comes on top here and basically Rick who has two hydropump turn one and sack his Gardevoir because the only things he can go into to take a hyper voice or Bisharp is a V bisharp
          
          which is just going to get to ako and can't kill and return and Landers T which is slower and gets to @k out so he basically just sex his Kelly oh right here to hyper voice and basically now on fuga it's a lot easier for him to just break holes that weave out because one of the you know one of the faster things on Rick whose team pretty much just took a heavy hit and it's just done so I'm vocal already isn't has initiative six five on the next turn Rick who's gonna bring in his low penny now I'm forget
          
          actually hearts were just into his keldeo and take 60% from return okay that play isn't that bad he predicted the ice punch and his Kell deal with scarf I predict the ice punch because maybe Rick would just go for that you know trying to a kale and arugula can't get extra helmet damage or you know what's the word rocks up for free so I do understand how his play obviously yes he gets punished for it heavily and it was kind of like a crazy play to make but I do understand where he's coming from anyway now I'm focused this out he
          
          can just easily break who already lost one of his great water resists so you know he just calls on Eladio it does 23 and all of uncle goes other moves just do much more if he wants to I see wonder secrets or those are gonna be doing a lot I see one might even to a KO at this range and I fuga has pivots in the back in turn in terms of heat transfer he can even stack Gardevoir and then force to pursuit because if he forces the pursuit on latias then rake who actually just loses to the move hydro pump providing
          
          it hits so I'm polka actually end up going his guard over knowing that if he wants to double predicting the heat trend you know this is still a fine sec and if he just kills this thing off well now he can go into his we file and you know just get it started so he's going to go right into weave up and by turn five Rick turn six Ricky has already lost two pokemon and his two main water resists are out of the game and at this point the game is very very heavily and unfocused favor because that turn one put him in such a high
          
          advantageous position to where Rick would literally could not recover this entire game is an extremely easy one from a programmers non-spoiler he does win and at no point in this game at all is Rako ever in like what's the best way to describe it he never has the advantage he's always playing from the back but because I'm foo got the lead matchup right he pretty much had this very very easily he's got the play smart you just to play patiently and he beat him quite easily um so you up on Bocas just gonna you
          
          know make these plays but brings in Kelley I finally and just ends the game goes for the knock off here done so that's basically what happened he got the lead matchup correct he got the initiative to start up the battle and that was basically it for a coup I understand Rico's mentality for sure leading off with the Cal deal but even if he let off a low penny I don't think he lost that much because he could obviously just go into if he let off al Andres if I'm googled off at Landers he just go back into his own Landers get up
          
          rocks and that kind of thing but he had to end up stacking to the fairy-type turn one and that ended up hurting him a lot so with that let's just move on to the next thing one of the biggest things you need to keep in mind in terms of whatever your battle is is what people call the wind condition and that phrases kind of thrown around a lot it also thrown around a lot with risk versus reward and that kind of thing and I'll actually talk about risk versus reward after this but let's talk about wind
          
          conditions so when people say wind conditions it's usually one two I'd say about three Pokemon on your team that are going to do a lot of work versus your opponent it's very very rare that in your battle all six of your Pokemon will be completely instrumental in beating your opponent it's very rare that all six of them will have some big job they need to do okay it's called a six pokémon team because some will be useful some won't be and you're just trying to cover everything with those six but most of the time no not all six
          
          are going to be needed so let's let's look for example so here's a battle I had versus Frizzi for SPO week five now if you're looking at my team I have an offense team Frizzi has a semi stall team so basically what we can instantly see from this is hip out on is useless versus frizzy he has a Sableye a gastro a clef and a breather I even a torn what is this doing literally I can't even get up rocks because frizzy has a Sableye so I can see right here that this is just done it's dead weight nothing I look at
          
          my drill and I see wow frizzy is extremely weak to life for Beck's goodra as we can see it can almost kill every Pope it can almost do AKO every Pokemon actually came to Akio every Pokemon and even OCO drill I mean okö is clefable and he trend with iron had an earthquake respectively and once san goes up it's also faster than torn so I can just rock slide that thing out of the way on top of that it provides spin support for me and I realized that if he ever is able to get up rocks I can spin for my next biggest
          
          threat Charizard why looking frizzies team and look at Charizard why absolute destruction save like his wall destroyed breelan destroyed clef can t wave but it cannot switch in gastrin destroyed he Tran can take one focus blast actually ki Chan could take a thousand focus bus you know that move on hit but I jokes aside he tranq cannot switch into focus blast only thing you can really do is thread with a toxic turning test he can't even kill with hurricane and again hurricanes not even gonna hit in the Sun
          
          to begin with so that's a losing battle I can see that my law Dios isn't going to be too useful at all versus frizzy because he has he Tran and cough able not to mention torn can knock me off and stable I can actually take two hits also has knock off and that kind of thing to get rid of my life orb and just kill me in general Ferrothorn extremely useless when he has a Sableye and we vile which is just life orb so it actually is walled by Sableye clefable and gastro by wall I mean it just can't do a kill them so it's just
          
          gonna get recover stalled so that's basically my mentality was I'm basically playing a two versus six game now obviously I'm not really playing a two versus six game I do have four other Pokemon that might do something in this battle but I realized here that if I somehow lose my Charizard y and I lose my exceed row I've lost there's nothing I can do to break his team and I will lose this game 100% so that my mentality was okay these are my when conditions now the second part to this is just because you've done your wind conditions
          
          and you've realized what you need to do to win doesn't mean you just start playing the battle this is true for pretty much any competitive thing sports the eSports in general and I'm not really comparing them that much because let's be honest Pokemon while it is a competitive thing I'm just going to say a Pokemon is not as hard as almost any other competitive game or eSports or whatever it's not as hard but it's still the same thing it happens in sports and all that your once you hit a certain level or you're at the equal level to
          
          your opponent you're no longer really playing the game but you're playing the player you need to understand it's not just you playing a team you're playing a human being on the other end of that game and you need to start playing the human that's like a big deal so you can see in the battle you know what they're doing how they're playing how you should work around that and that sort of thing so basically the first thing I always do in terms of tournament is I find my Quinn condition and then I like quickly scan over their
          
          team and see okay what are they gonna do you think frizzy didn't know at team matchup that he's going to get absolutely rocked by driller and zard why he definitely knew so he must have been thinking okay how should I play around this obviously this is just a kind of a nuisance for me to deal with um and that kind of thing but I realized from frizzies end he's probably going to be going through the mentality of okay maybe I should play smart with my tornadoes T it seems like he doesn't have any good flying resist that kind of
          
          thing if I knock off hippo I can hit that thing hard with hurricanes um his mentality also is okay's Charizard why is obviously a big threat but if I get cliff Abel in at 100% on it I can always throw it at E wave he's probably thinking okay he trend can deal with Latios so if I get up rocks ASAP that'll help me stay black and knock off all the items but also throwing wisp out and his mentality is probably I also have to keep those rocks of preserved Y so that's what he's thinking about I knew in his head he was definitely going to
          
          want to keep the key trend and Sableye alive the most I realized those two are going to be the absolutely most instrumental versus my team even if they don't do that much I knew say blank left we're gonna be the two killers so pretty much I went into mind knowing that okay I need to watch out for those three Pokemon because that's what's frizzies gonna try to play the best around with so let's just hop right into the battle I lead off with drill against broom now this it might seem weird to lead off
          
          with drill I mean you don't release people really don't really drill but my mentality was first is gonna expect me to lead off with my Charizard why so he's going to lead off with his Heatran to get the into the toxic off or he's gonna lead off with clefable to get up the Institut wave so my mentality was this covers both options and then I can just get up a heavy hit instead Frizzi leads off with this broom which were actually gonna find out his scarf brigham I knew it was something like that or it was toxic or just because
          
          there's no reason for him to have some weird life orb technician Breloom on semi stall so for that I'm going to switch out immediately into my Ferrothorn because I'm like first of all Ferrothorn is near useless as we as we talked about earlier if he has the Sableye what is Ferrothorn doing absolutely zero as the actions appoint for spore so I was like this is awesome um because now I know he can't go for any one move that kills me and even then he didn't bring in his Sableye so I'm going to get up a spike and I like as
          
          soon as I is that in this battle I remember getting like really excited during this game because I was like oh my god I'm gonna get up a spike cuz I have no business getting um hazard to persist his team anyway both of my hazard setters they completely shut down by Sableye but because the lead matchup actually ended up kind of working for me with my switch to Ferrothorn I'm able to get up a spike which is gonna help a lot because five of his Pokemon are grounded and he has no spike resist so he ends up going for
          
          spore we see no toxic Orem here which led me to believe he's scarf and a three turns later he's going to confirm that but anyway I'm able to get the spike here as it goes in the heat trend now here I switch into my hip out on now as he goes for his rocks here I was like I don't even care dude like you want a lava plume burn me go ahead I need to get these rocks up because again I was like wow he's giving me the opportunity to get up another layer of like hazards against the team that I shouldn't be
          
          able to get hazards with so I'm like really acting on this battle like okay this is gonna help my win cons like anything if I can get up rocks for tornadoes t2 always take damage I was like this is gonna be amazing my drill is actually to destroy him as well as Charizard why he's I'm like he's not anything to be able to switch in that he turned anymore because it's gonna be taken like 25% each time so he taunts me that kind of thing um here I actually double out I'm 100% sure he's either going to go into gastro Don or Bree
          
          looms so I double out here into my Latios and that actually works out for me but since we see sand hit him first I'm like okay he scarf 100% I switch right out of there and I go into my Ferrothorn and then I'm like yes stable I still has not come in I'm gonna get up that spike and we're just going to be able to really beef up my wind conditions and that kind of thing so beat up the second spike as he brings in the heat Trent and I'm like you know what virtually all right back in the hip or whatever if I get burned forget it
          
          what do I really need this for I don't why would I keep my hippo so safe like I could go into Latios on that kind of thing but Latios is actually gonna do more that hippo does in this game I don't have to keep all six of my Pokemon I know I don't need this and you're gonna see that shown even more in the battle because he did just crit meter with lava plume so it's like okay if he stays in here in lava plumes for some reason he is going to kill me but instead I just go right for the rocks like again if he loved applique with me
          
          it happens I don't need this though and I end up getting rocks and two layers of spikes up versus frizzy like it's absolutely fantastic like I should have gotten any of these layers up and now it just becomes real easy so look I even roll in there again don't need to waste time recovering what do I need a bulky hip out on for so we can still lose the clefable and gastro and literally everything else no reason so I just rollin my son and actually end up bringing in zard which is fine I'm just going to go for
          
          the roost here as he foul plays and that kind of thing now um and uh boosting again as you bring the heat trend here I switch out now look I could easily focus blast the heat ran but it doesn't kill at 78 if he's a fully spit upset um so like what if I miss if it doesn't kill what if he goes for a toxic now I just put one of my to win conditions again drill Zarda why those are the two win conditions I literally look at one of those get damaged and put on a timer for no actual reason now he can play around with his
          
          combination of clef torn and Tzar I mean clef torn and heat rent and if I lose my Zord that's one of my biggest breakers just out the way and that's just stupidity why would I have to risk that but if I switch on into Latios or I switch out in general and I scare off the heat ran well now if I get the hard back in heat transmitted at 56% I think right 56% and not wait is it it wait what no it it comes at 50 whatever dude I comes on like 51 or something I don't know um yeah but it's sorry about that
          
          uh it comes in like 58% and then I'm able to just kill him a focus blast for sure because that's a 100% kill rate so I'm gonna wanna Latios there because why not play it safe latias again it's not that good of a pokemon versus his team he has the torrent he has the trend he has the clefable it's whatever he has she ends up doubling into his cough able which I assume what he did was predict the Focus Blast and he wanted to Thunder wave in the following turn to get rid of me but uh that didn't actually end up working
          
          now here I actually go into my hip out on it's a well-known fact that extra Joe is one of the biggest offensive checks to clefable but why would I risk that what if for some reason frizzy was calm my flamethrower moonblast soft-boiled which is still a decently common set if I went into my first I went into my uh what's got extra drill there and what if I went to my X which was there and he just did 50% to me well then basically I just let one of my wind conditions take half for no actual reason and then I'm going to have a much
          
          much harder time sweeping because my lifework turns are just decreased by half I little use five terms of attacking because I don't want drill to take hits to begin with I do not need to do that so I went in the hip out on just playing as safe as the best play but Frizzi knows I mean they're going to go into that or driller so he makes the go play of going into his brew loom um and at this point I think I just actually end up staying in here because again why would I go into my Latios or whatever
          
          trying to catch the thing or like I just don't have to useless Pokemon here I might as well just you know do what I can so case against a force palming predicting my Ferrothorn but it just it helps me out anyway he goes in a tauren blah blah EQ here hurricanes me compete uh he gets a confusion when I roll in them out I go into my audios on the gastro as he doubles out again into his torn I actually end up switching in a weave out here cuz i pregnant knock off but he end up late for hurricane and missing
          
          he's the bulkier sparing his torn so uh what was I gonna say um he actually doesn't kill me with hurricane here it still sucks cuz I wait done like 60% hurricane is so strong but I mean it's like a focus blast so I miss whatever attacks this Pokemon sorry about that is what it is so at this point here I end up just going for the iscope crash I believe as he brings in his clefable I end up missing myself as well so I can't force the recovery anymore but again I go into my hippo because I'm like wait
          
          why risk drill in any case hippo Don's actually has enough spit F to actually be able to take two moon blasts recover I can do the whole whirlwind thing again but why would I risk my ex would on a possible flamethrower I can play this safe because I know exactly what my wind conditions are I don't have to go crazy with it so he's gonna switch out there and bring in his bring them here again I guess predicting this or whatever but yeah at this point I'm just gonna go back I'm gonna stay in as he seed bombs
          
          because I was like a kid I don't need this and I don't want to risk Ferrothorn as much as I want to risk hippo as he seed bombs and that does absolutely nothing cuz start boom is actually a horrible set so I'm gonna go back into para thorny seed bombs blah blah blah I don't want to risk crits because I don't really need to when I have this safety net and now first is gonna go into tornadoes and I'm like wait this is actually fantastic now look it's very obvious he's going to go for the fire remove heat wave and I'm going to lose
          
          my Ferrothorn but again what do I really need this for when he has the Sableye and the heat ran I'm like okay maybe I can Jarboe get off damage in a pursuit trap him and that's exactly what happens I do the damage he kills me off I go into weave I trap him gone and that's that's like the last thing faster than both my heart and my drill I pretty much took out both forms of speed being scarf broom and torn and I'm like now these two are actually going to blow him away so he goes Mike left I switch out there
          
          I finally go into hip harden again because I'm like okay I still wall him I can take two he ends up creating moom actually no he doesn't criminal he crits me blasting he later okay so I'm roaming the mouth I'm gonna Lodi else cuz again that's the designated gastro check I think I recover here yep because I can just keep using my pivots he actions of creating the boom blast this time yeah so he crits me here so I'm like damn it there goes my hip powered on but I was like okay it's fine he has no actual
          
          ground resist is a life for excadrill which is just is it that's bad news I'm an irony here because again I still don't know if he has the fire type move of flamethrower and we're not risking two here so I go for the iron head it's a pretty risk-free play I take 10% of these sexes heatran and now he's gonna go into Sableye now look I could have gone into zard here expecting the recover or willow it was more more obvious that he would definitely go for the recover but what if for some reason he found play
          
          there's no reason to risk that especially when we vial is completely walled by his last three Pokemon it came to it KO any Pokemon on this side and they can always recover on me so I just second go for the ESCO crash I flinch him that I missed this one now here I knew 100% he was gonna recover because he wouldn't just I would die to lie for him and he wouldn't want to be at 50% so here I could make the charger play it was like no question he would never attack here but here I'm gonna be able to bring this in again um I actually
          
          just flamed through here even though foul play only does 40% whatwhat do I need a 60% chars are instead of a 50% for why would I do that like what if he gets critted just go for the flamethrower get him out the way now play I'm not even gonna roost here I'm just gonna flamethrower again get him out the way there's no reason for me to make that play because I can always spin later once I kill the ghost and win with my solar beam from this he goes nickel fable now here you might think it's weird that I went into Latios instead of
          
          Xcode ro um because you know I mean Latios instead of Weavile because we've all dies the hazard but I wanted to literally cover every single option am I even my team I was asking me after this why'd you even make that plain they were saying it's bad but it's not and I'll explain you exactly why here if I go into Weavile but Frizzi predicts that and goes into gastro Don now what do I do I cannot go into Zard why because um for one it's gonna die the hazards Latios might not kill with Drake alignment
          
          confirmed kill chance I pretty sure just doesn't kill and um he could start cursing up on me and then it's just getting it really really hard I can't grow in a driller because he actually is something max defense and so if I if I spin so that my sword can kill him he can just earthquake knock out my driller so let's say that he did going to guess you're on an dissect my we've out well then I'm forced to spin with driller or I'm forced to crit fish with Latios either one is still horrible for me and
          
          then um he kills my driller and then it's my Zord and says I see sacs the gadget onto a solar beam so it's not zard and Latios francisco fable he thunder waves on my flamethrower sorry he soft-boiled I get paralysis on the flamethrower and now I've lost he's just gonna call mine on me and I've lost the game because Latios ends are do I cannot be clefable absurd why has been paralyzed and that's a big deal so I realized ok let me go into this now here I know a hundred percent he's not going to what's a cold um going to gas run
          
          that would just not make sense so I said okay here's the Turner sack that we about and it works out gone I can go in the driller I know here there's no way he has slammed or he's already revealed all of his moves call mine moonblast t-wave soft well I just earthquake here on the off chance he really wants to go into gastro he goes for that I kill him what the next one I spin here above with my sword wise so this might have been a really long like explanation sorry about that but I really just want to show you
          
          the whole wind con thing I never had to risk my Zord or my drill they were going to be the most instrumental in this game they actually ended up getting every single kill with the exception of tornadoes which died - without pursuit and breathing which ended killing itself all by itself I didn't touch it once it died to hazards + sin damage so basically that's what you need to understand I need to keep my wedges healthy frizzy also do the same thing Sableye and clefable were the last two I said stay black with fable and trainer
          
          to be the last one standing Tran was the fourth to die the third to that and he kept gastro because I had the you know curse on it so you know it could work that kind of thing but he kept his when conditions I kept my wing conditions and it ended up with mine winning because I just played them safe so with that let's move on to the next step okay so something that everybody let's to talk about when it comes to competitive pokemon is the whole aspect of risk versus reward and like when people say
          
          stuff like every turn is a fifty-fifty em blah blah and all that like it's okay basically what you need to understand about risk and reward is when people say that it has to do with prediction and um let's give you let's give an example for say um say if I make this certain move with my Pokemon I will be in a very very very good position for this the game in fact if I make this move I have a 95 percent chance of winning the game but what if um my opponent makes another play and my prediction or whatever my
          
          play is doesn't end up working out and then I put myself in the back and I'm at a disadvantageous position now you need to think is it really worth it for me to make this play if it ends up costing me the game if it doesn't work out that's what risk versus reward is you need to understand is this play really worth making um if it can just give me these horrible like a horrible backlash if it just it just doesn't work out so basically what risk versus word is is it worth making this play and you need to analyze
          
          what the con the pros and the cons are every single play you go for in battle almost every single play of the battle you need to understand what's going to be what's gonna help me if I go for this play but what's what's going to not work if this doesn't end up working out so a refund I have here that really shows the whole risk versus reward and like I guess and also a sense a senseless prediction if we want to call it that I probably just put these two terms together and just call it like two points because like they're they're
          
          similar but they're also kind of nap anyway let's get into this cosine 180 versus two song so this was for SPO SPO week three yeah so they're both in or SL u cosine cosine has a pretty balanced team honestly like I like that a lot it has the surp talents is work or so it is a SERP Talent star me up says are you know mr. Jam bag you know mr. Jam my wet dream right here Amy hip out on so but as you can see these are awesome great Pokemon you know very good bulky set up sweepers that can really just tear holes
          
          in the opponent's team the song is running a more offensive team with a little twist he actually has a spec secured in black which is very very interesting not something you would ever really see I don't think I've ever seen anyone run it besides him but it has a very good match at Brisco signs team it can comment on hippo kill it akin to a KO clef a Draco meteor comes very very close to killing talonflame but it just barely misses out on it but does that really matter because if you just get up
          
          a little bit of damage on Talon then it's going to get blown away SERP Walled gets ice beam obliterated star miracle meteor and step song even as the tech HP fire just forces or and Ferrothorn so he can even OCO that thing so if you're looking at it it looks like this is just going to be a cure on bat black buffet this song even has volt turn support from manectric and landers t so let's hop right into it so the song actually ends up getting the lead matchup very very well I think cosign was predicting the Cure
          
          and black lead uh predicting the song to predict the hip out on leads with offices or but the song reads right through that leads right off with this knowing that cosine is going to lead off with something that doesn't give himself a bad lead matchup versus Karen black so he leads off with his manectric and that works out very well for him cosines gonna immediately actually I think oh yeah the song immediately switches out thinking okay he's just gonna go and hit powered on let me get that Karen black
          
          in so you know the song makes two great plays all of a sudden in one turn like he predicts the lead matchup and he's gonna make the double instead cosine goes into his clefable knowing that even if he goes into Bisharp you can always just counteract that thing with it switch to hippo now this is where it's like I guess the mystery of the battle comes in and again I'm not ripping on to son he's a good friend of mine blah blah blah this is just an example of what I said risk versus reward now Tesla does not really need to stay
          
          in here ice beam will not kill the clefable he might end up getting moon blasted and take 60% or he'll get thunder waived and he'll just be put on commission completely but if he wants to switch you to say his klefki he can start getting the spikes put out Thunder wave of his own he can bring then in the hip he can then actually bring in the Karem confidently on the hippo which was more like more or less likely what's going to comment on the cholesky and then he can just throw one of his hard-hitting special attacks instead he
          
          actually goes for the HP fire and does 30% now he again he knows he'd have to make this play we know he didn't have to make this play it is what it is the done thing whatever uh he tried to catch the scissor immediately now he really didn't have to make that play right there I think cosines mentality was okay even if he's like a life form iron head or whatever I just want damage on this thing that way you know it's not a big a nuisance to like my SERP and my talent and all them later on in the game which
          
          I can totally understand coming from cosign side um and he probably thought Michael Faber was not even gonna be doing much work when he has a cholesky and a bit sharp anyway but - song HP fires dead so - song played the first - the first turn and the lead matchup very well put us off in a really good advantageous position but then he takes the moon blast takes 60% cosign even knows its specs so he's gonna be able to bring in his hip out on and he's gonna be able to get up the rocks the next turn so - son took his lead and pretty
          
          much just kind of dropped it like that not only is his set completely on blast now it's very obviously specs but he gave us a point of free rocks and his wind Khan took 40% when it would have been able to do a lot of work even as it's not even as the bishops actually pursuit sharp so it can't even do much work either and his lung actually ends up losing this game unfortunately because then cosine knows the you know like that he knows what's up he knows the trick of the set and then it's just very very
          
          easy to play around and he ends up winning so this long like again I'm not ripping on him that's my dude like it's just an unfortunate situation where he didn't really assess risk versus reward as well as he could have any ends up losing it pretty much his best Pokemon to do a cosines team like that and then cosines very easily able to just you know clean out the game from there I believe he ends up winning off with winning on this call mine clefable but yeah let's move on to the last and final step of the video okay so the last
          
          step we want to talk about is looking ahead in the battle so this can kind of like I don't know this can range like when you're in your battle you know you might be thinking like two or three turns ahead of what's going to happen you could be think of seven turns ahead you could be mr. jam bed and you could be thinking about turn 43 when it's actually turned three but who knows like look looking ahead in your battle is it pretty much a key thing and pretty much everyone thinks about it you need to
          
          think like okay if I make this play what's going to happen in two plays if I set up with my bisharp you need to think okay but if I do drink I'll meter with my Latios then he can go into his bisharp and set up and then am I screwed like you need to think hmm like what are the it goes back to the pros and cons of your place because you need to think okay if I do this play now in a couple of turns I might actually just end up losing or or if I make this play now in a couple of turns I might have my win
          
          condition paved for me immediately so let's get into this replay I have right here of me versus a br for SPO this is also week three I like the cosine - son game so basically I can see from my lead my perspective actually let me switch the size I know people were asking for that for me to be on the left side or whatever so anyway um basically what I can realize is here is if I trap ABR's Magnezone it looks like pincer can actually destroy him because I'm most close combat pincer - for the teat R and
          
          the drill so I was like okay that's looking pretty good I also have the mag which is just amazing and so I was like okay these are going to be my two most important Pokemon basically to deal with his team even on top of that it looks like specks Magnezone on its own is actually kind of a threat so that was basically my wind condition at that point in a sense and looking ahead in the battle I need to realize okay what turns am I going to be able to bring these two threats in and just you know make games off that so ABR's team is a
          
          little bit bulkier he doesn't exactly have a hard hitter besides specs keldeo but he relies on that plus spikes + call mine cliff able to pretty much do his breaking in a sense um but you know let's just skip through this battle real quick - like a relevant turn okay so I actually kind of skipped the head like a lot as you can see it's for Pokemon the five Pokemon but this is basically when we can start seeing the whole looking ahead in the battle because up until this point from both sides we were kind
          
          of just feeling out the like feeling out I guess each other is in terms of opponents and seeing like okay what can we do to kind of get the initiative we both knew from the beginning that I was going to try to use Pinter to destroy him and he was going to try to use a drill to destroy me + bikes we both we both knew that was basically was going on here um on top of that spikes color is also a pretty big threat to my team but at this point I think it's Peck Scout that like ten percent burned or so it's like it's out like 15
          
          percent and burned and there's rocks up so if it comes in and kills something is gonna die it only goes one kill max so basically let's just hop right into it um at this point you're probably looking at the battle and you're thinking okay it's looking like the biggest threat to a BRS team is definitely the combo of Pinter play zone so let's skip ahead a little bit going to Landers there you turn out on the clefable kill him off a return and again it was four or five and that's gonna be for four hours I killed
          
          this off as he goes back into scarm here's what you to understand it might look like pictures the biggest threat but Landers tea is on par with pincer in terms of how a milling it is to ABR now you might be thinking how is that even possible it's the defensive Lander is teeth but Landers tea you turns on Skarmory if Skarmory gets below 25% or even like 28% I think I think it's 28% stone edge still kills I could be wrong though but say scarm is at 25% stone edge kills it he cannot go into his Co
          
          do because that thing's that 15% it just dies even if my attacks somehow misses it's gonna die - rocks + burn so that's it teeters flower dies extra can't kill dies so even though it's a DES from the beginning you would have never thought defensive Lando we'd do anything versus a br but around halfway through the battle I was like wait a minute this is actually an important part of my team I need to keep this thing healthy so basically here ICC blah blah SD here because I was like re I'm tired of this
          
          um as he ends up sacking the UH what's called Tyranitar and here I was like okay again the liner is gonna be important if I ever I need to keep Landers healthy because then I can deal with the driller if I you turn on his switch to scarm BAM incomes Magnezone trap done Pinter's going to destroy him so I was like okay this is looking good right now so here I go back in the land Risty he just iron heads again he goes in a Cal deal because look he can't even go into his ask arm there he can't you turn I mean because if I
          
          you turn which I am going to go for here because it's my 100% best play we saw iron head to absolutely zero damage if I you turn on the scar he's gonna get trapped by the Magnezone done pincer sweeps done games finished so he has two sec to kill deal here dead so now what was a 4 vs. 5 is now actually a 4 vs. 2 because of the combination of defensive Landers luring in only because as soon as I killed off latias he actually switched in lodi as to one of my you turns from Landers early game because
          
          again that thing was always again it's not a heavy hitter but it's a big threat because it invites Magnezone to get rid of its only switch in uh as in only landers to switch n Skarmory and then pincer is going to eat so I switch out of there I go back into my Landers T here because again you know we've kept the HP healthy I've not switched him into anything besides drill even iron heads again here because he's like this is it this is the only play I have but I use around there I bring in pincer Assisi does sort of a 50/50 yeah
          
          that was a 50-50 um so yeah we kill him off get rid of that income scar and we just CC Romans gets the sack kill him off the end so even though Lander steed did not look like a problem I thought ahead to where Landers T I mean I was thinking ahead in the game that these three pretty much mag pincer and Landers T would be the most important once ABR played this game great I mean I think I played pretty well I mean end up winning and that kind of thing it's just a well played game on both sides of the battle
          
          and we were both looking ahead as to what what we could do to win in a be ours mind he was always like I just have to play round Magnezone that so he was always looking ahead to if I make this play I could lose the Magnezone blah blah so a lot of 5050 s and that kind of thing I hope this replay kind of showed I guess what it has to do with um the whole looking ahead I don't know this is the perfect example but I think the other examples were going anyway okay so I'm actually coming back to this
          
          video like three days later um I actually realized I was about to render this that I actually only put up four tips and it suppose to be five and you know Lord Pope came you know he gave me some quick advice he said you got to talk about Pokemon as a game of numbers and that's very very true and something that needs to be talked about even though everybody like hates talking like this Pokemon is a game of numbers and hex exists and luck exists and sometimes should your team be absolutely garbage
          
          to where you have an unwinnable matchup because I'm of the firm opinion that if you have an unwinnable matchup at Rs your team is probably bad that is not count for ladder when I use fun stuff and they get sick so by stall okay if okay this is more tournament geared I suppose cuz like you can make a team on ladder and do well with it and still be sick so by certain play styles because the ladder actually encompasses everything but in tournament if you're sick so my comment styles such as stall and hyper off a so that kind of thing
          
          that your team is just poor if you have no countermeasure to play against that your team is poor but anyway um to break when I'm down like to break that one I'm saying if you're in a certain situation where you cannot break the team here's the like your opponent's defensive core is too good you have no way to player on this threat you have to you have to just play the numbers game you have the hacks like at a certain point like if your if your actual win condition like you thought of everything in your
          
          when condition is literally burned his amongest with Kelly oh you double that Kel do as many times you can and you just spams called and you just burn that Cal deal and the only way you can win is to just create your move like you have to put yourself in your position to do that you only way you can win he's the iron head flinch down his like Zapdos with your jirachi you bring it you have to go for that like at a certain time like if you're if you have like messed up in your game or if it's just some
          
          like I said it's just really really hard to win this is the only way you can win you have to play the numbers game that's basically you have to come to terms back because like eventually it will come down to hex if your matchup is that bad but yeah Pokemon as a numbers game like I guess that's at a certain point like if it gets that bad you have to hex but it should never have to come to that unless again your matchup is that horrendous or you miss played to put yourself in that position you should
          
          never like have to like you should never go into the game with the mentality that okay I'm just gonna critical fable and then I'll win the game like no that's that's definitely not a game planned um but again if it ever comes down to like something like that again Pokemon game of numbers and it writ like at a certain time you just you just have to go for and more like in the night you'll get reward because this is Pokemon so yeah hope you guys enjoyed that should be the end of the video for real now later oh
